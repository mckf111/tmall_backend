# TMALL Back End Practice

This is a Back end management system simulation of the [tmall - the biggest b2c shopping website in China](https://www.tmall.com). The original idea comes from a project practice in a JAVA learning website: [how2j](http://how2j.cn/).

This project is based on **SSM (Spring-SpringMVC-Mybatis)** frameworks, **Mybatis Generator** has been utilized to alleviate the development difficulty. Also, thanks to the [PageHelper](https://github.com/pagehelper/Mybatis-PageHelper) for pagination support!

### I have deployed the whole Maven Project in Alibaba Cloud (阿里云), so everyone can visit at [BACKEND](http://47.254.135.201:8080/backend_ssm/admin_category_list) directly!
